# Special Functionality Description

The special functionality of this lab is the addition of an admin user. The admin user, for now, simply logs in with the username admin. As an admin user, one is able to kick any member currently in the chatroom. When a member is kicked from the chatroom, they are unable to send or recieve any more messages or see who is in the chatroom, and are free to close the window.
