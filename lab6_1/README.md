# Lab 6.1:
The functionality that I will be adding is a user account called admin. As an admin, someone can kick a user with the /kick command. The command takes one argument, the name of the user. For now, there will be no password associated with the admin account, meaning anyone can be an admin. Only someone who logs in with the username admin will be given admin privilages. If a user tries to kick someone but they are not logged in with an admin account, they will be denied. Kicking someone involves closing the socket connection with that person. The /list command has also been implemented for all users.
